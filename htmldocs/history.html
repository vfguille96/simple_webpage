    <h2>Automobile web - History</h2>
    <p>A NÂº1 news web about automobile world, data and understanding for the industry's decision-makers interested in
        North America.
        Automotive News serves top auto industry executives -- including vehicle manufacturers, their original equipment
        suppliers and franchised dealers -- plus others allied with the industry.
        Automotive News fairly, accurately, objectively and authoritatively provides its readers with the information
        they need, in a timely manner. This strong, ethical tradition of excellence in journalism dates to 1925 when the
        newspaper was founded, and is the underlying principle for Automotive News as it finds new ways to provide
        information and value to meet the changing needs of its readers.</p>
